# Creative Scala Template

This is a template project designed for people using the Doodle library from [Creative Scala][creative-scala].

1. Fork or clone this template. What's the difference?
   - If you fork this repository you get your own copy on Github. You can then clone that repository to get a copy on your computer and save work back to your fork on Github and share it with other programmers. 
   - If you clone this repository without forking you get a copy on your computer but no copy on Github that you can save work back to and share.

2. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt in this directory.
   1. In Visual Studio, go to Terminal -> New Terminal. There should be a terminal window that pops up under the code editor.
   2. Or, in Mac, 
      1. Press Cmd + Space to open the Spotlight Search. 
      2. Type "Terminal" to find the Terminal.
      3. Click that to open it.
      4. Go to this directory: `cd <path to>/creative-scala-template`. Replace `<path to>` with your directory path.
   3. In Windows, 
      1. Go to the Start Menu.
      2. Search for Command Prompt.
      3. Click that to open it. 
      4. Go to this directory: `cd <path to>/creative-scala-template` Replace `<path to>` with your directory path.
3. Run `sbt` (if you already have SBT installed), `./sbt.sh` (OS X and Linux) or `.\sbt.bat` (Windows) to start SBT.
4. Type `run` in SBT, then choose the "go" main method from the list and continue with step 7, or go to step 5 if you want to explore in a console.
5. Type `console` in SBT.
6. Type `Example.image1.draw()`.
7. You should see a pop-up window containing a picture of three nested circles. If so, everything is working well.
8. You can also run this in a GitHub Codespace. To see the pop-up window, go to the Ports tab, hover over the Forwarded Address, and click on the globe (Open in Browser). 

You can edit the file `Example.scala` to create your own code. See [Creative Scala][creative-scala] for more!
